# BestowFood
<I>India is home to a quarter of all undernourished people worldwide, making the country a key focus for tackling hunger on a global scale. In the last two decades, per capita income more than tripled, yet the minimum dietary intake fell. The gap between rich and poor increased during this period of high economic growth.</I>
 
  <b>This project aims to cater the need of food shortage which is experienced by many people in India by connecting food providers (Hotels, Restaurants, Banquet Halls & Individuals) and suppliers (NGOs).</b>

<h2>Economic Feasibility</h2>
In the fast-paced world today there is a great need for online website facilities, which can replace the manual existing system. It reduces the cost of hiring manpower to search for willing volunteers for donation of food. 
<h2>Operational Feasibility</h2>
Our Project solves the existing manual working of the NGOs to search for willing volunteers to donate food. It's much better than using the alternative solutions since all the requirements are met on one single platform rather than being scattered on all social media platforms.
