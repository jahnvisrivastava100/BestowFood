# BestowFood
<I>India is home to a quarter of all undernourished people worldwide, making the country a key focus for tackling hunger on a global scale. In the last two decades, per capita income more than tripled, yet the minimum dietary intake fell. The gap between rich and poor increased during this period of high economic growth.</I>
 
  <b>This project aims to cater the need of food shortage which is experienced by many people in India by connecting food providers (Hotels, Restaurants, Banquet Halls & Individuals) and suppliers (NGOs).</b>
